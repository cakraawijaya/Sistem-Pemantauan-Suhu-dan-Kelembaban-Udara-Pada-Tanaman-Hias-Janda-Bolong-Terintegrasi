# Monitoring-Suhu-Kelembapan-Udara-Tanaman-Hias-Janda-Bolong
<strong>Team Project - Informatics UPN Veteran Jatim</strong><br>
This project is closely related to agricultural technology, where this tool is used to monitor changes in air temperature and humidity in the environment around widow bolong plants in real time remotely anytime and anywhere. This tool is equipped with a Bot of Things (BoT) based interface that aims to facilitate users in caring for these ornamental plants. Janda bolong is a plant from the Araceae or taro species that can survive optimally at temperatures of 23-30 Â° C and air humidity less than 40%.

## Download & Install Arduino IDE
```bash
https://www.arduino.cc/en/software
```

<br><br>

## Settings
1. Open the Arduino IDE first, then enter the Boards Manager Url by copying the following link:
   ```bash
   http://arduino.esp8266.com/stable/package_esp8266com_index.json
   ```
<br>

2. Board Setup in Arduino IDE
   <ul>
      <li>Method: click Boards Manager -> ESP8266 Boards -> NodeMCU 1.0 (ESP-12E Module).</li>
   </ul>
   <br>
3. Port Setup in Arduino IDE
   <ul>
      <li>Method: click Port -> Choose according to your device port (you can see in device manager).</li>
   </ul>
   <br>
4. Install Library in Arduino IDE
   <ul>
      <li>Method: click Tools -> Manage Libraries -> Install Library according to project needs.</li>
   </ul>

<br><br>

<br><br>

## Get Started
1. Download this Repository.
   
2. Make sure you have the necessary electronic components.
   
3. Make sure your components have been designed according to the diagram.
   
4. Make sure the components are well connected ``` (Adjust Board and Port settings) ```.
   
5. It is recommended to ``` create a IoT Platform account ``` along with this service.
    
6. Make sure to change the arduino program code in the ``` Router ``` section according to the device you are using.
    
7. If you do not apply points 2 and 3 for the purposes of project development, it is fine, but please note that some things need to be changed in order to function properly.
    
8. Done, good luck.
